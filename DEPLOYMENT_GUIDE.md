## 🔧 Current Setup

### Demo Mode (Currently Active)
- Uses `simple_model.py` for demonstration
- Generates realistic random predictions
- No TensorFlow dependency required
- Perfect for testing the web interface

### Production Mode (Optional Upgrade)
- Switch to `model.py` for real ML predictions
- Requires TensorFlow installation
- Train with your own crop disease dataset

## 📊 Features Available

### ✅ Currently Working
- **Web Interface**: Beautiful, responsive design
- **File Upload**: Images and videos (JPG, PNG, GIF, BMP, TIFF, MP4, AVI, MOV, MKV)
- **Disease Detection**: 6 disease categories + healthy plants
- **Treatment Recommendations**: Detailed remedies and prevention tips
- **Disease Database**: Comprehensive information on crop diseases
- **API Endpoint**: RESTful API at `/api/predict`

### 🎯 Disease Categories
1. **Apple Scab** - Fungal disease with dark spots
2. **Bacterial Blight** - Bacterial infection causing leaf spots
3. **Powdery Mildew** - White powdery coating on plants
4. **Leaf Spot** - Various fungal/bacterial spots on leaves
5. **Rust Disease** - Orange/brown pustules on plant surfaces
6. **Healthy Plants** - No disease detected

## 🚀 Usage Instructions

### For Farmers/End Users
1. Open http://localhost:5000 in your browser
2. Click "Start Detection" or go to "Detect Disease"
3. Upload a clear photo or video of your crop
4. Get instant results with treatment recommendations
5. View detailed disease information and prevention tips

### For Developers
1. **API Usage**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST -F "file=@crop_image.jpg" http://localhost:5000/api/predict
   ```

2. **Switch to Full ML Model**:
   - Install TensorFlow: `pip install tensorflow`
   - Edit `app.py`: Change import from `simple_model` to `model`
   - Train with your dataset using `train_model.py`

## 📦 Installation & Dependencies

### Basic Setup (Demo Mode)
```bash
pip install flask werkzeug pillow numpy
python app.py
```

### Full ML Setup (Production Mode)
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python train_model.py  # Train with your dataset
python app.py
```

## 🔄 Upgrading to Production

1. **Collect Dataset**: Organize crop disease images in folders
2. **Install TensorFlow**: `pip install tensorflow`
3. **Train Model**: Run `python train_model.py` with your dataset
4. **Switch Models**: Update imports in `app.py`
5. **Deploy**: Use gunicorn for production deployment

## 🌐 Deployment Options

### Local Development
```bash
python app.py
# Access at http://localhost:5000
```

### Production Deployment
```bash
pip install gunicorn
gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:5000 app:app
```

### Docker Deployment (Optional)
Create a Dockerfile for containerized deployment.

## 📈 Performance Metrics (Demo Mode)
- **Response Time**: < 1 second
- **File Size Limit**: 16MB
- **Supported Formats**: Images and Videos
- **Concurrent Users**: Suitable for small to medium usage

## 🔧 Customization

### Adding New Diseases
1. Update `disease_database.py` with new disease info
2. Modify `class_names` in model files
3. Retrain the model with new categories

### UI Customization
- Edit templates in `templates/` folder
- Modify CSS in `base.html`
- Add new pages by creating routes in `app.py`

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Port Already in Use**: Change port in `app.py`
2. **File Upload Fails**: Check file size and format
3. **Model Errors**: Ensure correct model is imported

### Getting Help
- Check console logs for error messages
- Verify file permissions in uploads folder
- Ensure all dependencies are installed
